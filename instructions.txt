To run:
run command     gcc bankers_algorithm.c -o bankers_algorithm
run command     ./bankers_algorithm -r [m] -p [n]
    where:
            m is the number of resources
            n is the number of processes

You will then be prompted to enter:
    The number of units for each resource m and
    The number of units each process n claims from each resource m


To make a request:
type    request(i, j, k)
    i is the process number, j is the resource number, and k is the number of units that process i is requesting from resource j

To make a release:
type    release(i, j, k)
    i is the process number, j is the resource number, and k is the number of units that process i is releasing from resource j
